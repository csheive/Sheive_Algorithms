# False Position
## Bracketing root finding method
### Inputs
User inputs function, lower x bound, upper x bound, desired relative error, and the maximum number of iterations.
### Outputs
Algorithm outputs the approximate root of the function over the inputed bounds, the value of the function evaliated at the approximate root, the approximate percent relative error, and the number of iterations done.
### Limitations
User must have an idea of two x bounds between which the root occurs.
This algorithm currently does not have a default for when the user inputs four values.
