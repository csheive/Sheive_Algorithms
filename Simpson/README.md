# Simpson's Algorithm
### Inputs
User must input x and y vectors with which the algorithm will use to approximate the integral.
### Outputs
Algorithm outputs the integral approximation.
### Limitations
User inputted x vector must have equally spaced elements.
Simpson's 1/3 rule is used to integrate initially, if there is an even number of x vector elements, the last segment will be integrated using the trapezoid rule.
Integral value calculated by algorithm is an estimate, not 100% accurate.
