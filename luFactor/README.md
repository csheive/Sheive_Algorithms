# LU Factor Decomposition
## Factors 3x3 square matrix into upper and lower triangular matrices.
### Inputs
User inputs a 3x3 coefficient matrix for a system of three equations.
### Outputs
Algorithm outputs the decomposed upper and lower triangular matrices for the inputted coefficient matrix.
### Limitations
Inputted coefficient matrix must be a 3x3 square matrix.
